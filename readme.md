# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting diabetes using machine learning models. It includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle:
- [Diabetes Binary Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girishvutukuri/diabetes-binary-classification)

The dataset contains several features related to health metrics and a binary class variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.

## Notebooks

### 1. Logistic_regression_notebook.ipynb

This notebook trains a lr model to predict if a patient has diabetes.

## Streamlit Web Application

The Streamlit web application allows users to input their health data and get predictions on whether they have diabetes or not. It's a simple and interactive interface for real-time predictions.

To run the Streamlit app locally, use the following command:

```
streamlit run diabetes_prediction_app.py
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the dataset, train models, and evaluate performance.

4. Run the Streamlit app and input patient data to get predictions.
