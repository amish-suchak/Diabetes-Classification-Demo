# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting diabetes using machine learning models. It includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle:
- [Diabetes Binary Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girishvutukuri/diabetes-binary-classification)

The dataset contains several features related to health metrics and a binary class variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes or not.

## Notebooks

### 1. Data Exploration.ipynb

This notebook explores the dataset to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables. It includes visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

### 2. Model Training.ipynb

In this notebook, machine learning models are trained using the dataset. Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest classifiers are implemented and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.

### 3. Model Evaluation.ipynb

The trained models from the previous notebook are evaluated further using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are also plotted for detailed analysis.

## Streamlit Web Application

The Streamlit web application allows users to input their health data and get predictions on whether they have diabetes or not. It's a simple and interactive interface for real-time predictions.

To run the Streamlit app locally, use the following command:
